This is GerbMerge, a program for combining Gerber (i.e., RS274X) and Excellon
data for making electronic printed circuit boards.

The main documentation for this program is in doc/index.html.  Quick start
information is below for the impatient; more detailed installation and
execution information is in doc/index.html.  Sample files are in
/usr/lib/python2.4/gerbmerge (or similar) or C:\Python24\GerbMerge (or
similar).

Quick Start
===========

Requirements:

  - Python 2.4 or later
          http://www.python.org

  - eGenix mxBase package 2.0.4 or later
          http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html

  - SimpleParse 2.0.0 or later
          http://simpleparse.sourceforge.net

Download GerbMerge:

   http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python

Installation:

   Unix:   python setup.py install      (as root)
   
   Windows: gerbmerge1.6.exe            (DO READ installer messages)

Running:

   Unix:   /usr/local/bin/gerbmerge -h

           # To test example files
           cd testdata
           make

           # To view merged output, install gerbv from http://gerbv.sourceforge.net
           make view1
           make view2

   Windows: - Open command prompt
            - Type (assuming Python is in C:\Python24):

                C:\Python24\python C:\Python24\lib\site-packages\gerbmerge\gerbmerge.py -h
                         OR
                C:\Python24\gerbmerge.bat -h

            - To test example files:
              
              cd C:\Python24\gerbmerge\testdata
              ..\..\gerbmerge layout1.cfg layout1.def
              ..\..\gerbmerge layout2.cfg layout2.def

   GerbMerge operation is controlled by two files, a job description file and a
   panel layout file. Samples have been installed in the Python library
   directory, something like:

             /usr/lib/python2.4/gerbmerge/testdata

   or

             C:\Python24\gerbmerge\testdata
