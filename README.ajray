Ajray's notes for using GerbMerge:

under Ubuntu you need the packages:
    python-simpleparse
    python-simpleparse-mxtexttools

Also you have to solve the python dist-packages/site-packages issue.
   Theres a lot of ways to do this, I just move all of them into dist-
   and symlink the other to point to it
